                        Water Heater works on a simple principle. Solar water heating systems
                        using vacuum tubes made of borosilicate 3.3 which is very good for absorption of heat with special coating to absorb the solar energy called as Evacuated Tube Collector system. Inner glass tube is coated with the world best magnetron sputtering HI- tech layer of CU/SS-ALN with AL base.Vacuum tube, shown in the sketch, is the main component, which absorbs solar energy. The vacuum tube is an assembly of  concentric, borosilicate glass tubes.Air between the gap of two glass tubes is evacuated. It results in high level of vacuum which acts as the best insulation to minimize the heat loss from inner tube. Black coating on the inner tube absorb the solar energy and transfers it to the water. The water on upper side of Vacuum Tube becomes hot and get lighter, so it starts moving upwards in the tank. At the same time cold water, which is heavy, comes downward from the tank and  stored at the bottom. The phenomenon is
                        called as natural Thermo syphon circulation, which occurs in every tube.
